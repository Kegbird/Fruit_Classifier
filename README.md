# Fruit_Classifier
This repository contains a colab sheet with the code to train and evaluate a CNN to recognize fruit by type and variety.
To use this you need to download the .kaggle file of your kaggle account, upload it on the colab file system and then run all blocks; the .kaggle is needed to download images from the dataset Fruit-360.

All the experiments conducted are explained in Report.pdf.
