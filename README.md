# Fruit_Classifier
This repository contains a colab project developed for the course MSA @ Unimi; the code provided allows to train and evaluate a custom CCN on the dataset [Fruis-360](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits).
Two different network are built to solve 2 classification problems:

-Fruit type classification
-Fruit variety classification

#Performances

The classification is very high on both experiments:

Fruit type classification: 

Train accuracy = 100.0 %
Test accuracy = 98.80 %

Fruit variety classification:

Train accuracy = 99.99 %
Test accuracy = 97.59 %

All details about the experiments conducted are in Report.pdf

#Usage
